Hi! My name is **Gabi Cavalcante**. I'm a software engineer passionate for Python, Data Science, Distribute Systems, Tests and Quality Engenier. 

<!--more-->

I work at [Cloudia](https://www.cloudia.com.br/), we build a intelligent virtual assistant for medical clnics. I specificly work with the chatbot and creating solutions focusing in tests and estability. Now my challage is to optimizate the data processing and the transfer of a large amount of data between the services.

At Cloudia I work mostly with Python, and web frameworks like [Flask]() and [FastAPI](), but I also build a [chatbot load testing in Golang](https://github.com/gabicavalcante/chatbot-load-testing), to simulate many users seding messages to a bot and register a few metrics (CPU, memory, threads, uptime), the idea is check the performance of a bot keeping a conversation. Another tecnology that I use is the Redis Queue, recentily to build a broadcast microservice using FastAPI.

But, stop talking about work, I'm graduated in Information Technology at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) with Sandwich Degree (2015-2016) fulled funded in France (Polytech Nice Sophia) by the exchange program BRAFITEC. I am also a of the founder of PyLadies of Brasil. And I love coffe =)
