# Positions

#### -- Cloudia

| Title      | Start   |
| ---------- | ------- |
| Python Dev | 03/2019 |

**Technologies**: Python, Flask Framework, Mysql, Pipelines CI/CD, Pytest.

I work at [Cloudia](https://www.cloudia.com.br/), we build a intelligent virtual assistant for medical clnics. I specificly work with the chatbot and creating solutions focusing in tests and estability. Now my challage is to optimizate the data processing and the transfer of a large amount of data between the services.

At Cloudia I work mostly with Python, and web frameworks like [Flask]() and [FastAPI](), but I also build a [chatbot load testing in Golang](https://github.com/gabicavalcante/chatbot-load-testing), to simulate many users seding messages to a bot and register a few metrics (CPU, memory, threads, uptime), the idea is check the performance of a bot keeping a conversation. Another tecnology that I use is the Redis Queue, recentily to build a broadcast microservice using FastAPI.

I also made a CI/CD to run our tests and deploy the code using Github Actions, so now all pull request only can be merged if all tests passed ;)

### -- TSMX

| Title      | Start   | End     |
| ---------- | ------- | ------- |
| Python Dev | 08/2019 | 03/2020 |

I worked at TSMX developing solutions for the management system for internet providers. I created a solution to optimize the generation of large pdf reports, I also implemented integration with [Cielo](https://desenvolvedores.cielo.com.br/api-portal/en/content/api-ecommerce) and [GalaxPay](https://www.galaxpay.com.br/) to build a payment solution that allows simple transactions and recurring payments (the major request from the clients). Another contribution was to implement a feature to generate Nota Fiscal ([an official document that proves the existence of a commercial act](https://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/complete-guide-to-issue-nota-fiscal-in-brazil)). This solution was based on the original lib [PyTrustNFe](https://github.com/gabicavalcante/PyTrustNFe) with my additional support to my State Government rules. 

**Technologies**: Python, Flask Framework, Django, Postgres, Pytest.

### -- Surfmappers/Crossmappers

| Title               | Start   | End     |
| ------------------- | ------- | ------- |
| Back-end Python Dev | 01/2019 | 07/2019 |

[Surfmappers](https://www.surfmappers.com/home) is a marketplace for surf photos, a platform to help photographers to sell surf shots. The company created a similar solution for CrossFit athletes, the [Crossmappers](https://www.crossmappers.com/). 

I provided solutions for the backend side of Crossmappers, using tecnologies as Python, Pyramid, Flask and MongoDB. I developed a solution for face recognition to find the athletes faces in the snaps and suggest for them buy it. I used the [MAX-Facial-Recognizer](https://github.com/gabicavalcante/MAX-Facial-Recognizer), a project developed as part of the IBM Code Model Asset Exchange using a model is based on the [FaceNet model](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).

**Technologies**: Python, Flask Framework, Pyramid Framework, Mongo.

| Developer and Researcher | 04/2017 | 04/2019 |

Federated identity management model provides a solution for credential access proliferation, such as based on passwords. However, it only takes the attacker to find out one password in order to personify the user in all federated service providers. The multi-factor authentication emerge as a solution to increase the authentication process robustness.

In this project, I worked as Developer and Researcher at GT-AMPTo (Multi-Factor Authentication for Everyone) developing a solution for multi-factor authentication to be used on the CAFe Federation. My contribution was build a transposition of such authentication through the physical, allowing Federation Authentication with IoT using (FIDO UAF Standard)[https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/] and NFC. The prototype implemented in Python to PN532 reader can be found [here](https://github.com/gabicavalcante/nfc-prototype) and a similar solution to ACS-ACR122U reader is [here](https://github.com/gabicavalcante/ACS-ACR122U).

**Technologies**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino, C/C++, Python, Flask Framework, FIDO and NFC.

### -- Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte

| Title                    | Start   | End     |
| ------------------------ | ------- | ------- |
| Developer and Researcher | 09/2016 | 07/2017 |

I worked as researcher at [Smart Metropolis Project](http://smartmetropolis.imd.ufrn.br), conducted in the Metropole Digital Institute (IMD) of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), in Natal-RN. In this project, I worked on Infrastructure Work Package (WP), and the activities developed by this WP are composed of two work fronts. The first one is related to the development, deployment, and operation of the computational environment (datacenter, servers, cloud, networks, etc.) to enable applications developed within the SmartMetropolis Project to work efficiently.

In turn, the second one refers to the development of an autonomous smart hotspot for Internet access, with capacity to offer connectivity to people and devices in the urban environment. This research was supervised by Prof. Carlos Eduardo da Silva. My work on this project involved security, authentication, authorization.

**Technologies**: Python, Flask Framework, JS, Docker, Git.

| Developer and Researcher | 04/2014 | 07/2015 |

Scientific Initiation Scholarship at the Digital Metropolis Institute (IMD), under orientation of Carlos Eduardo da Silva. I was working on a tool to a Multicriteria Approaches for Cloud Services Selection, to solve the issue of selection of cloud services based on the analysis and use of methods, models and algorithms for selection which meet multiple criteria.

With the visibility that cloud computing has been acquiring, it is observed that the provision of computational resources as services is growing increasingly, leading to a large number of services being offered. These services have heterogeneous managerial and technical specifications, so that organizations wishing to use such services need mechanisms to assist in the decision making process to choose one that best suits their needs.

**Technologies**: Java and RDF.
